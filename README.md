# flight-price-prediction models-using-R
A predictive modeling project in R to estimate flight ticket prices using airline, stops, departure time, days left, and duration. Three models (linear regression with train-test split, cross-validation, and regression tree) were built and compared using RMSE, MAE, and other metrics to identify the best-performing approach.
